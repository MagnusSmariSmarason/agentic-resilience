## Problem-Based Learning (PBL)

### Origins

PBL originated at McMaster University in 1965, formalised by neurologist Howard Barrows. The core insight: learning through problem-solving creates knowledge far more usable in practice than memory-based learning.

### Evidence Base

- **Academic achievement**: Meta-analysis across 70 studies found an aggregate weighted effect size of d+ = 0.652 for PBL over traditional instruction, with engineering and technology disciplines showing even stronger effects (SMD = 0.619)
- **Critical thinking**: Effect size reaches 1.081 under random-effects models — PBL doesn't just teach content better; it fundamentally develops how students think
- **Long-term retention**: Strobel and van Barneveld (2009) meta-synthesis confirmed PBL is superior for long-term retention, skill development, and student satisfaction

### Six Essential Characteristics (Barrows)

1. Learning centred on students
2. Small groups (optimally 4–5 participants)
3. Teachers as facilitators, not lecturers
4. Problems as the organising stimulus
5. Problem-solving skills as core learning outcomes
6. Self-directed information-seeking

## Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle (1984)

Learning is "the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience." Four stages:

1. **Concrete experience** — Encounter the problem
2. **Reflective observation** — Examine what happened
3. **Abstract conceptualisation** — Form theories about why
4. **Active experimentation** — Test theories in new situations

**Critical finding**: A 2025 systematic review found that only 30% of implementations fully realised all four stages. This methodology treats the complete cycle as non-negotiable — every session must include all four stages.

## Dewey's Pragmatist Philosophy (1916, 1938)

Knowledge is created through inquiry and problem-solving in real-world contexts. Not all experiences are educative — they require structure and reflection.

Dewey's "complete act of thought":
1. Encounter a problem
2. Define it precisely
3. Suggest possible solutions
4. Reason about consequences
5. Test through action

This maps directly onto PBL session design in this methodology.

## Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development

The ZPD — the gap between what learners can do independently and what they can achieve with support — is where cognitive growth is maximised.

**Key finding for this methodology**: A meta-analysis of 144 studies on scaffolding in STEM found a consistently positive effect (ḡ = 0.46), with a counterintuitive result: cognitive outcomes were superior when scaffolding was NOT prematurely faded. This methodology uses sustained, contingent scaffolding that fades based on demonstrated competence rather than fixed schedules.

## The Einstellung Effect

### What It Is

The tendency to apply familiar solutions even when better alternatives exist. The German word "Einstellung" means "setting" or "attitude" — a mental set that constrains problem-solving.

### The Research

Bilalić, McLeod, and Gobet (2008) used eye-tracking to demonstrate that the Einstellung effect reduced expert chess players' problem-solving ability to that of players three standard deviations lower in skill. Critically, experts continued fixating on features of their first solution even when they reported searching for alternatives. The mechanism is unconscious.

### In Technical Education

Manifests as:
- Framework fixation (using React for everything)
- Design pattern overuse (inheritance hierarchies where composition is superior)
- Solution-first thinking (choosing architecture before analysing requirements)
- Tool dependency (assuming your AI tool's approach is the only approach)

### What Works Against It

- Howard, Maier, Onarheim, and Friis-Olivarius (2013): Educating students about fixation reduces its constraining effect — awareness itself is partially curative
- Neroni and Crilly (2021): Demonstrating individual vulnerability to fixation is more effective than general warnings

### The Five-Phase Approach (Used in This Methodology)

1. **Induce**: Present problems solvable with a familiar technique
2. **Trap**: Introduce a problem where the familiar technique works but is suboptimal
3. **Reveal**: Surface the fixation through reflection and comparison
4. **Force**: Remove the familiar tool entirely
5. **Transfer**: Present novel problems requiring conscious evaluation of multiple approaches

## Understanding by Design (Wiggins & McTighe)

The curriculum architecture for this methodology:

**Stage 1 — Desired Results**: What should participants understand and be able to do?
**Stage 2 — Assessment Evidence**: How will we know they've learned?
**Stage 3 — Learning Plan**: What experiences will enable learning?

The key insight is "backwards design" — start with desired outcomes and assessment, then design experiences. This prevents the common trap of designing activities that are engaging but don't lead to the intended learning.

## Jonassen's Problem Typology (1997, 2000)

Eleven problem types ranging from well-structured to ill-structured. This methodology operates at types 6–11:

- **Troubleshooting**: Identify and fix faults in systems
- **Diagnosis-solution**: Analyse symptoms and prescribe remedies
- **Strategic performance**: Apply tactics to meet goals under constraints
- **Case analysis**: Evaluate complex, multi-faceted situations
- **Design**: Create solutions that satisfy competing requirements
- **Dilemma**: Navigate situations with no clear right answer

These share critical characteristics: multiple valid solutions, incomplete information, competing perspectives, and uncertainty about which principles apply.
