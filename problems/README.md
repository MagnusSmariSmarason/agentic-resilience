## The Problems

| # | Problem | Domain | Duration | Difficulty |
|---|---------|--------|----------|------------|
| 00 | [Hello World](00-hello-world/) | Environment setup, first commit | 2–4 hrs | Beginner |
| 01 | [The Developer Who Vanished](01-the-developer-who-vanished/) | Software security, code audit | 6–10 hrs | Entry-level |

### Recommended Sequence

Start with Problem 00. It sets up your development environment and teaches the basics of git, GitHub, and working with AI. Problem 01 assumes everything Problem 00 teaches.

## Problem Descriptions

### 00 — Hello World

The on-ramp. Set up a professional development environment (VS Code, Git, GitHub CLI, Node.js) using AI as your guide, then fix a tiny broken web application and make your first git commits.

**Step 0:** Meet Your AI
**Files:** [`00-hello-world/`](00-hello-world/)

---

### 01 — The Developer Who Vanished

A developer at a small Icelandic tourism company disappeared, leaving behind SkyCRM — a 300-line Node.js/Express application riddled with security vulnerabilities, data corruption, and zero documentation. The student must take it over using AI, with no coding experience.

**Step 0:** Repository Safety Audit (inspect before cloning)
**Files:** [`01-the-developer-who-vanished/`](01-the-developer-who-vanished/)
